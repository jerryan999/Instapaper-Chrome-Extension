Instapaper Chrome Extension
===========================

I don't use any bookmarking tools with any regularity other than
Instapaper, and I don't need an extension that does anything beyond
simply sending articles into the service.  This extension aims to
make that as simple and streamlined as possible.

The extension has two features:

1)  Clicking on the instapaper icon in the address bar will submit the
    current tab's URL/Title to Instapaper for later reading.

2)  Pressing `ctrl-p` on any page has the same effect.

The first time you attempt to submit a URL, a popdown will appear, asking
for your Instapaper username and password.  As soon as you enter a working
pair, the URL will be submitted, and you can move on with your life.

None of these behaviors is in any way configurable.

If you're looking for options and functionality that this extension
doesn't provide, check out
[Instachrome](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/fldildgghjoohccppflaohodcnmlacpb)
(also [on GitHub](http://github.com/edgarjs/instachrome) ).  It's
nice, and I learned a lot reading through Edgar's code.
